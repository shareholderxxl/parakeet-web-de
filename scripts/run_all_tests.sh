# Run the full parakeet_web test suite: all three tiers in one go.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/run_all_tests.sh              # build the app, then run unit + http + e2e
#   ./scripts/run_all_tests.sh --no-build   # skip the app rebuild (faster; only safe
#                                           # if app/ui/dist is already current)
#   ./scripts/run_all_tests.sh --no-e2e     # tier-1 + tier-2 only (no Playwright build/run)
#
# Why this exists: "all the tests" spans three tiers wired through two
# package.json files, plus a build step the e2e tier silently depends on:
#   - tier 1 (unit): node --test test/unit/*.test.mjs
#   - tier 2 (http):  node --test test/http/*.test.mjs
#   - tier 3 (e2e):   playwright test  -- runs against the BUILT app/ui/dist,
#                     which is gitignored and can be stale, so we rebuild first.
# Running them by hand is easy to get subtly wrong (forgetting the rebuild
# tests an OLD UI). This wraps the canonical sequence with a fail-fast exit.
#
# Deliberately NOT run here (they are diagnostics/benchmarks, not pass/fail
# tests, and need a real, FREE GPU -- which this suite's headless Chromium has
# no access to, though webgpu-check itself runs fine headless ON a GPU box):
#   - npm run webgpu:check / webgpu:memcheck   (WebGPU adapter probe)
#   - node scripts/wer-bench.mjs               (transcription quality WER)
# Run those by hand, or via the .githooks/pre-push WebGPU opt-in.
#
# Run from anywhere; the script cd's to the repo root itself.
